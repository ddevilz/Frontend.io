### What I learned

The HTML code for the application is very straightforward. It consists of a main container, a date form, and a result section. The date form contains three input fields for the user to enter their birth date. The result section displays the user's age in years, months, and days.

The CSS code for the application is used to style the different elements of the application. The main container is styled with a light blue background color. The date form is styled with a dark blue border and the input fields are styled with a white background color and black text. The result section is styled with a light blue background color and the text is styled with a dark blue color.

The JavaScript code for the application is used to handle the user input and calculate the user's age. The `getAge()` function is called when the user clicks the submit button. This function validates the user input and then calculates the user's age. The results are then displayed in the result section.

Here are the steps involved in calculating the user's age:

1. The `getAge()` function is called when the user clicks the submit button.
2. The function first checks if the user has entered a valid birth date.
3. If the birth date is valid, the function calculates the user's age in years, months, and days.
4. The results are then displayed in the result section.

### Continued development
